# Rock-Paper-Scissor
PROJECT: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS (TheOdinProject)


This is the README for this exercises.

I will be putting some final thoughts:

	* V1 of the exercise was basically to get some confidence with the functions and all the stuff we have
	learned so far, it's pretty simple. Not the most efficiente code.

	* V2 was ''born'' when i asked help from a reddit user (r/italy!). He tipped me some suggestions like:

	" why evaluate the loss? It's faster to evaluate two things (draw and win) 
	rather than evaluating three things!

	* V3 the struggle was with V3 because i tried to loop V2. After some struggling, i eventually sneak-peeked
	some solutions at the forum. Well, i can say that:

	- Functions parameters are necessary
	- I must think more when coding, the passage:

	 console.log(oneRound(playerSelection(), computerSelection())); 

	of line 96 is obvious, but it wasn't. I kept having just one solution looped over and over; so when peeking
	a solution, i was pretty bamboozeld.

	Basically that line says "Hey, print this function around an input that I give and a random one from the PC".
	What i kept doing was printing a function with just ONE input instead of multiple inputs. And i need to
	improve on the return.
